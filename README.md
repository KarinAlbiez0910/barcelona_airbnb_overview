Project Motivation

This project (Write a Data Science Blog Post) is part of Udacity Data Scientists Nanodegree Program.

I used Barcelona Airbnb Dataset for this project.

The dataset describes the listing activities of homestays in Barcelona, Spain.

The data is drawn from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain: listings.csv.gz


This project focuses on answering following questions: 

1. What are the top 15 amenities in terms of frequency (=amenities I should consider offering)?
2. What are the top ten locations in terms of popularity?
3. What factors are related to the renting price?


Libraries
I use Python3. 
Here are the libraries I used in my Jupyter Notebook:

numpy

pandas

sklearn

seaborn

matplotlib.pyplot

##Summary of the results:
1. The top amenities in terms of frequency are (with respective counts): 
{'Wifi': 16414, 'Essentials': 15511, 'Long term stays allowed': 15135, 'Kitchen': 14954, 'Hangers': 13830, 'Washer': 13273, 'Hair dryer': 13190, 'Heating': 13071, 'Iron': 12708, 'Air conditioning': 10924, 'Hot water': 10861, 'TV': 10776, 'Shampoo': 10116, 'Dishes and silverware': 9371, 'Elevator': 9323}
2. The top neighbourhoods in terms of ratings are the Eixample, Ciutat Vella (Old Town) and Gr√†cia
3. The factors that drive a high rental price cannot be clearly discerned.
