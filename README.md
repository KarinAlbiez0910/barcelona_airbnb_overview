Here is the Medium blog post I have written: https://medium.com/@myalbiez/ever-wanted-to-offer-an-airbnb-apartment-in-barcelona-3198aa8aec8e

Project Motivation
This project (Write a Data Science Blog Post) is part of Udacity Data Scientists Nanodegree Program.

I used Barcelona Airbnb Dataset for this project.
The dataset describes the listing activities of homestays in Barcelona, Spain.
The data is drawn from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain: listings.csv.gz


This project focuses on answering following questions: 
1. What are the top 15 amenities in terms of frequency (=amenities I should consider offering)?
2. What are the top ten locations in terms of popularity?
3. What factors are related to the renting price?


Libraries
I use Python3. Here are the libraries I used in my Jupyter Notebook:

numpy
pandas
sklearn
seaborn
matplotlib.pyplot
